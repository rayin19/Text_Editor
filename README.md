# Text Editor

This project is a comprehensive Text Editor Application developed in Java, utilizing JavaFX, Java Swing, and Applet libraries. The application offers a range of features to enhance text manipulation and analysis.

## Features

The Text Editor Application includes the following key features:

- **Text Loading**: The application allows users to load text from any .TXT file, enabling seamless editing and analysis of existing text documents.

- **Flesch Index**: The Flesch Index feature calculates the readability score of the loaded text, providing insights into its complexity and readability.

- **Word Distance**: Users can determine the distance between two words in the text, representing the number of steps required to transition from one word to the other. This feature offers valuable information about word relationships and connectivity.

- **Markov Text Generation**: The application generates Markov Text based on user-defined parameters. By specifying the desired number of words, users can generate new text that reflects the patterns and structure of the provided input text.

- **Highlights and Underlines**: The Text Editor highlights and underlines new words in the loaded text, making them visually distinct and easy to identify. This feature enhances readability and comprehension.

- **Spelling Suggestions**: Users can access spelling suggestions for misspelled words, aiding in the correction of typos and improving overall text accuracy.

- **Auto-complete**: The application provides auto-completion functionality, suggesting possible word completions based on the user's input. This feature saves time and reduces typing errors.

- **Unit Tests and Other Tests**: The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests and other tests to ensure the stability, reliability, and quality of the Text Editor Application.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- **Language**: Java
- **GUI Libraries**: JavaFX, Java Swing, Applet
